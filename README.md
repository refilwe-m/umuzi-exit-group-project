# C27 Collaboration Project

## About

This project is a fun, collaborative portfolio site for Umuzi graduates to showcase their personalities and skills after completing their projects. It's designed to be more casual than a traditional CV site, emphasizing creativity and personal expression.

## Project Vision

We're creating a digital space where each cohort can:
- Build something together as a team
- Feature individual members with interactive avatars
- Showcase personality through customized profile cards
- Create a lasting record of their cohort experience

## Goals

1. **Enhance Collaboration Skills**: Address the transition from solo projects to team-based work
2. **Create Cohort Identity**: Build a unique digital footprint for each Umuzi cohort
3. **Improve Real-World Readiness**: Simulate collaborative development environments
4. **Establish Legacy**: Create an evolving showcase of Umuzi's community
