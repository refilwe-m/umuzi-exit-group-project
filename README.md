## About

This project is a fun portfolio site for anyone to showcase their skills post umuzi projects.

The idea is for a cohort to build something together, pin different faces on the site, then when a user clicks on the person's avatar/pic then it takes then to a customized size that shows a little bit about them, the project should be casual and not used as a proffesional CV site, but somethung that shows personality.

One can link their basic portfolio site or build a totally new card just sharing some cool info about themselves.

## Goal

[Umuzi](https://www.umuzi.org/) has been a great learning experience, the syllubus has a lot of gold knowledge. A problem I observed on our first interaction with a company, it was that a lot of Umuzi students were used to working on repos by themselves being the sole contributor and externals were people reviewing the code and not contibuting to it. This does affect the dynamics of team work and team contribution.

I thought it would be cool to add a collaboration project to the [syllabus](https://syllabus.africacode.net/) where a cohort can come together to build something cool, the idea can be anything but for now I figured it can start as an "I was here" kind of a thing, where each cohort builds something about their cohort, shows every person that made the cohort and things that they like while also emphasizing the endless catalog of all the cool people Umuzi has trained.

In the same sense a brownfield project is also a necessary project that can be introduced where students inherit an old codebase and they work on refactoring it, making it better while adding new features to it. All in the spirit of just aiding cover small gaps that I think can help a new intern somewhere gel easy with their teams.
